# AR Multiplayer Game

This is an AR multiplayer game developed in Unity where two players—a host and a client—control augmented characters and shoot each other until one player is defeated. The game features real-time multiplayer interaction, with health bars displayed above each character that deplete as they take damage.

- **Augmented Reality**: The game uses AR to overlay characters onto the real world.

- **Room Management**: The host can create a room that the client can join, enabling multiplayer gameplay.
